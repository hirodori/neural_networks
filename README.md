Application to reconstruct the calculation of gravity value using Neural Networks.

It utilizes the historical data of signals collected from other accidents and analyzed by a medical team:

qPA: quality of blood pressure; results from the evaluation of the relationship between systolic and diastolic pressure;
pulse: pulse rate or Beats Per Minute (BPM);
respiratory rate: breathing frequency per minute;
gravity: a value calculated based on the above vital signs;
gravity classes: there are 4 classes that indicate the health status of the injured person.

The medical team developed a formula to calculate the gravity of the health status of victims and established ranges that define the following gravity classes:
1 = critical,
2 = unstable,
3 = potentially stable,
4 = stable.
